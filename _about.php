History
<br>

I am the always curious and often playful founder  of FindMyMonkey.com. I was born in 1990 at the Corcovado National Park in southwestern Costa Rica. Here, as an infant, my Mama and Papa exposed me to the bright lights of Hollywood and cinematic prowess of Clint Eastwood with the comedic masterpiece, “Every Which Way but Loose.” As the T.V. flickered to life in the family den, I became enraptured not with the former mayor of Carmel, but with his side-kick and co-star Clyde the Orangutan. Seeing Clyde roam the San Fernando Valley, looking for cold beer, country music and the occasional barroom brawl, I longed to be in his shoes. More importantly, I knew I had found my calling – movie stardom.

Arriving in Hollywood, I  found early success working as background talent on “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” and “12 Monkeys,” but my career eventually stalled and as I struggled to pay rent and buy enough bananas to feed my appetite, much less enjoy the burgeoning luxuries of Los Angeles. Determined not to quit, I put my jungle-smarts to the test and I searched high and low for the city’s best deals. As irony would have it,  I found my true calling. 

FindMyMonkey.com presents my latest finds to you in an easy to navigate website. Here, you can find massive savings on a wide array of purchases, ranging from restaurants to clothing to gym memberships. But most importantly, they are IN YOUR CITY, so take a look around for the deal that suits you best.
