What is FindMyMonkey and how does it work?

FindMyMonkey collects all of the daily deals from every group buying site and sends them to you in one daily email. If you do not want to receive an email you can visit our site daily to see the deals!

What kind of deals do you feature?

Every day we feature 50% - 90% off deals on spas, salons, restaurants, gyms, classes, theater, and everything else that is fun to do in your city.

What is the deadline on these deals?

The key to getting these deals it to check your email or our site daily. Most of these deals run for a 24hr time period while few may last longer. So don't procrastinate!

Where do you find these unbelievable deals?

Group buying has become a hot industry over the past year. Due to this there are well over 80 sites currently offering daily deals. We track all of these sites so you don't have to and present the deals in one easy to read location. Why receive 80 different emails when you can get just 1? 

Sites we track: GroupOn, LivingSocial, BloomSpot, BuyWithMe, Zozi, FreshGuide, and many, many more!

Do I purchase these deals from your site?

No. We do not process any transactions on our site. By clicking one of our deal links you will be redirected to the deal site hosting that deal. We are simply trying to bring you all of the deals in one place so you don't have to scour the net.
